# Hey! I'm `ThatCosmicStorm` ðŸ‘‹

- I'm an amateur programmer making projects to use and learn from.
- I have yet to turn to the dark side, e.g., Neovim, Linux, and Rust:
  - Currently only "specialized" in `Python` ðŸ˜…
- Languages I want to explore:
  - JS, Go, Mojo, Zig.
- Go check out [Quartz](https://github.com/ThatCosmicStorm/Quartz)!
