# Hey! I'm `ThatCosmicStorm` :wave:

I'm an **amateur hobbyist** programmer designing systems that are built to amplify *human thinking*â€”not machine efficiency. Currently, I am only comfortable using `Python` :sweat_smile:

- Featured Projects:
  - [`Quartz`](https://github.com/thatcosmicstorm/quartz) - A pipe-based language catering to how **humans think**, not machines.
  - [`Flowtimer`](https://github.com/thatcosmicstorm/flowtimer) - A pomodoro timer optimizing how *humans actually focus* through **flow**.
- Might explore `bioinformatics` (Keep a lookout for new repos :wink:)
