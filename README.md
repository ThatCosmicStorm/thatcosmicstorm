# Hey! I'm `ThatCosmicStorm` :wave:

I'm an **amateur** programmer aiming to amplify *human performance*â€”not machine efficiency.
Currently, I only use `Python` :sweat_smile:

- Featured Projects:
  - [`FlowState`](https://github.com/thatcosmicstorm/FlowState) - A productivity-optimizing program that recognizes **humans focus** through ***flow***.
  - [`Quartz`](https://github.com/thatcosmicstorm/quartz) - A pipe-based language catering to how **humans think** in a ***step-by-step*** manner.
- Might explore `bioinformatics` (keep a lookout for new repos :wink:)
